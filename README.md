# Journal:

This one is created based on graphical webpage with lots of assets. The hardest part was to find assets that's looks good and fit in with the theme, to the point where I had to make some myself because there's limited assets available with so many considerations to limit it further (free to use, fit the theme, looks good together, etc.).

In the end, I think I had achieve what I had in mind. It looks adventurous, inviting, easy to skim, and it blended well with medieval aestetic. While the content gives (maybe) more info than necessary, it's because I don't know what else to fill the sections with. Each game has it's own points to present, and this example webpage use non-existent game, so I decided to stick to what makes RPG games stand out, which is world-building.

There's a lot of assets on this webpage, but even though almost all of it was taken from different sources, I think it blended well to create one inviting webpage that sparks interest to make the visitor backing the game kickstarter.
